/* Three rules, and no more than three, on purpose.
 *
 * They are run against the ASSEMBLED program, not against the parts — see
 * tools/lint.py, and the ignores below.
 *
 * A linter's value here is not style — the file has a voice, and a tool that
 * argued with it would be switched off within a week. It is the small class
 * of mistakes that an 18,000-line single-scope program makes easy and that no
 * test can catch, because none of them is wrong at the point it is written:
 *
 *   no-unused-vars   the dead binding. A helper kept "for symmetry", a name
 *                    left behind by a refactor. Eight of these were cut by
 *                    hand in 0.9.20; the point of the rule is that the ninth
 *                    is found the day it appears rather than a year later.
 *   no-undef         the typo that becomes an implicit global — the one
 *                    failure mode of a program with no modules and no
 *                    bundler, and the one that shows up as a blank chart.
 *   no-redeclare     two declarations of one name in one scope. In a file
 *                    this long the second is never deliberate, and the first
 *                    silently stops existing.
 *
 * Everything else is off. Adding a fourth rule should take an argument about
 * a bug it would have caught.
