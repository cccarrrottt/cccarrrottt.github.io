    --partial   accept a source that is missing whole @@EDIT@@ regions, letting
                those regions fall back to what src/data.js holds
    --force     accept a source in which a region has lost most of its contents

Before either of the two files that hold the chart's contents is written over
— src/data.js on a pull, dist/nexus.html on every build — the previous copy is
put in .backups/, three generations deep.

WHY A BUILD STEP AT ALL

A published artifact is served under a Content Security Policy that blocks
every external host, so the page it serves has to be one file with the CSS
and JavaScript inside it. That is a bad way to WRITE the thing, so the
sources live apart — src/index.html, src/style.css, src/data.js, and the
ordered parts in src/app/ — and this script welds them into dist/nexus.html
for publishing. See APP_PARTS for what "ordered" means and why it is not a
module system.

src/index.html is a real, standalone document: open it through any local
server and the chart runs, with the stylesheet and scripts loaded normally.
Only the built file has them inlined.

ONE OUTPUT

  dist/nexus.html        the chart, as a whole <!doctype html> document.

There used to be four: editable or read-only, fragment or document, because
whether a copy could be edited was decided here, at build time. It is decided
when the page is opened now (see SITE_ORIGINS in src/app/01-store.js). On the
published site it is a reader until the owner signs in; opened off a disk or
served from anywhere else it is that person's own copy and saves into their
browser; on claude.ai it publishes itself through the artifact capability as
it always did. One file, so there is no second copy to forget to republish.

It is a document rather than the fragment the artifact host once wanted,
because the host accepts either — the page tries both shapes when it
publishes itself — and GitHub Pages and a disk accept only a document.

WHERE THE CHART'S CONTENTS LIVE

Not here. Pressing Save in the published page rewrites the @@EDIT@@ regions
of the PUBLISHED file, so the live artifact — not src/data.js — holds the
current entries, connector styles and stickers. A plain rebuild therefore
carries those regions over from the existing dist/nexus.html instead of
resetting them to whatever src/data.js happens to say. If you have edited
the chart in the browser since the last build, save that page and pass it
with --pull so the edits come back into the sources.

It carries them IN MEMORY. The built page gets the chart and src/data.js is
left as it was; only --pull writes back, because a build should not quietly
rewrite a source file. The consequence is easy to miss and expensive: dist/
is generated and not committed, so a clean checkout has no live page, and a
clean checkout is what CI is — what CI builds, and therefore what the
published site becomes, is src/data.js and nothing else, however far behind
it has drifted. Both of those situations used to pass without a word. Now a
build says when it had nothing to carry from, and says when what it carried
differs from the sources; tools/data_check.py asks the same question on its
own and answers with an exit code.
