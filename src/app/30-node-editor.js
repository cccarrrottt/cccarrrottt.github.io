/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   The in-node editor.

   An entry's words used to be written in the settings drawer: click the
   entry, find the pencil, and type into a form at the other side of the
   screen while the thing being changed sat where it always was. The two
   were connected only by a live preview — which is to say, by the reader
   watching two places at once.

   They are one place now. A double click puts a field on the entry
   ITSELF, at the entry's own width, in the entry's own face and size and
   ink, with the toolbar floating just above it. Enter settles it; so does
   a click anywhere else, which is what a reader does next anyway. The
   drawer still holds everything an entry has that is not its words, and
   its Label field still works exactly as it did — this is a second way in,
   not a replacement for the form.

   The entry underneath keeps redrawing as you type, so it grows and wraps
   under the field, and the field is put back over it after every redraw.
