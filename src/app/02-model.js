 * claim about how it looks — so an entry could not be a pocket reality and

 * was to not have one. The ripple is a border STYLE now, alongside the
 * four the connectors have always offered, and any entry may wear it.
 *
 * The names and the dash patterns are the connectors' own, so a dashed
 * border and a dashed connector are dashed the same way. `wavy` is the old
 * pocket border, unchanged in every particular — same wavelength, same
 * amplitude, same phase grid, same ports, same clipping of the arrowheads
