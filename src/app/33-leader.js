   Aiming the leader.

   Choosing where a note attaches is only half of placing one; the other
   half is where the card itself stands, and until now the chart guessed
   that — a search for somewhere clear, which is a reasonable guess and
   never the reader's own answer. So the gesture has a second half: pick
   the point on the connector, then move away from it and click again, and
   the leader is drawn from the point to wherever the pointer is.

   It is the same vocabulary the connectors already use, deliberately.
   Shift snaps — there, to the quarters of the line; here, to eighths of a
   turn about the anchor, which is what makes a row of notes point the same
   way as each other. Ctrl comes off the grid, so a leader can be any
   length rather than a whole number of steps. Nothing new to learn: the
   two keys mean here what they mean everywhere else on this chart.
