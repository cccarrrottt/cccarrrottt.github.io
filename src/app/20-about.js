   a copy has no other way of telling which one they have. The log below
   is written newest first and is the only record: everything before 0.9.0

  {v:'0.10.0', date:'2026-10-05', title:'A site of its own', notes:[
'The chart has a home that is not claude.ai. The published site serves it to every reader, and its owner signs in with GitHub and saves straight into the repository — through a small write service that checks who is asking, refuses everyone else, and refuses a save made from a page that is behind the chart already there. There is one page now, and it decides when it opens who may edit it, instead of four builds that decided in advance.',
'Corners are a choice: an entry, a connector and its notes and callouts can each be square instead of rounded. A wavy border and a wavy line keep their rounded turns, and the panels say so by greying the choice — including on a callout pinned to a connector, which wears that connector’s corners.',
'A wavy border no longer makes its entry wider, and a line without an arrowhead into an outer rippled border stops inside that border across its whole width rather than poking out between the rings.',
'A merge moves as one. A lineage pushed aside takes the whole merge with it — the other lineages, the amalgam and the bends set by hand between them — and an amalgam carried up under its lineages pushes them as a row. Its bar stays where it is while the merged arrow has room, and then moves in whole grid steps rather than a nudge of two or three pixels first.',
'Colours are checked wherever they are read, not only where they are typed: a chart from a file, from browser storage or from a hand-edited data file can no longer carry anything but a hex colour into the page.',
'The Management panel says why it refused something, and a refused link no longer wipes the good one it was typed over. The new-entry form offers corners too, and its background reset button does what it shows.',
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.31', date:'2026-09-18', title:'A card with four bands', notes:[
'An arrowhead goes UNDER the entry it arrives at, a rippled border included: the border is drawn over its tip, so the arrow arrives at the shape rather than lying across the thing it is arriving at. Only a head on an inner border ring is still drawn above, where it would otherwise be buried by every ring outside it.',
'An entry gives way at half the distance it used to. What a pair of facing sides needs to hold a connector was two full stubs and a corner apiece; it is half that, measured — at twenty-six a plain step is drawn, at twenty-four the route starts looking for a way round — so entries may be brought properly close before either is pushed. And a merge pushes the parents it is carried into, while a parent carried into the merge does not push it back: the bar hangs from where the lineages are, so the merge is the thing that follows.',
'A text is folded only where its author folded it. One Shift+Enter anywhere used to turn wrapping back on for every line of that entry, so adding a second line silently re-folded the first at whatever character the box happened to end on. The box widens to hold the longest line it is given, and past the width a box may reach the text is clipped — the bargain a spreadsheet cell makes.',
'Writing in a box gives it back the size its words ask for. A box shrunk by hand stayed shrunk however much was typed into it, and the text simply disappeared past the border with nothing to say why. A hand-set size is a statement about a text; a new text is a new statement.',
'The words of a rippled entry keep clear of its border, which swings a whole amplitude into the box and is stroked on top of that — the letters used to sit on the wave.',
'A double click no longer leaves the entry panel standing open behind whatever it opened. And on a card it asks WHICH of the two things in the box you meant: on the picture it opens the picture, with four corners of its own to pull — free, or proportional with Shift held — and on the words it opens the words.',
'A card sized by hand gives the room to its PICTURE. It used to hold the picture at a fixed depth and hand every pixel of the extra height to the heading, so dragging a card bigger produced a small photograph on a vast empty panel.',
'And a card has a fourth band: a middle line between the heading that names a thing and the note that cites it — "collectible card, back". The picture-band slider is gone from the settings, which is what the picture’s own corners are for, and the card switch is at the top of the panel where the choice belongs.',
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.30', date:'2026-09-18', title:'Fastened ends', notes:[
'A connector’s ends do not move. A port could spend a little of its own side on making a route come out straight, and the price was paid on every drag: carry either entry and both ends crawled along their edges, so the thing being moved was never the only thing that changed. The budget is gone and the machinery with it — a small offset is now a step in the LINE, between the two ends, where a reader can see what is bending and why.',
'The cap that redraws a connector where an entry’s outer borders are drawn over it is the line as it APPEARS, not the route it was cut from. It was handed the full geometry, so at an arrowhead it redrew the very stretch the head stands on: a headless line poking out from under every arrow on every entry with more than one border.',
'An arrowhead meeting a rippled border goes to the border at its own point. It used to be lowered onto the ripple far enough that no crest beside it could push into a flank — which left clear paper between the tip and the border directly beneath it, an arrow that had not arrived. The head is cut off at the entry’s own outline, so the wave takes back whatever it puts across.',
'While one entry is open, another entry cannot be carried — the same rule its link, its chips, its citations, its grips and its arm already follow. A press that missed by a few pixels used to pick a neighbour up and rearrange the chart behind the thing being read.',
'An entry is pushed only when it is actually in the way: the two boxes have to stand across one another, so that a connector between them must live in the gap. Growing the carried box by the minimum gap on all four sides shoved entries that were passing diagonally, from seventy pixels away, in whichever direction a corner happened to favour. And the gap held is the router’s own threshold, not a number of the push’s choosing.',
'The merged stem leaves from in front of its entry again. 0.9.29 let it settle onto the nearest lineage’s landing so the two would share one bead; that moved the foot of the merged arrow away from the entry it hangs from, and is reverted.',
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.29', date:'2026-09-18', title:'Room to be a line', notes:[
'A connector that meets an inner border is drawn as itself. The stretch of it that the outer rings are drawn over is redrawn above them — and until now that was not the line but a straight stub standing in for it, which on a wavy connector read as a second line crossing the first, and at an arrowhead ran up the middle of the head. The line is drawn again, clipped to the ring it passes under, so whatever it is made of the cap is made of the same thing.',
'An entry joined to a merge, without being part of it, bends its connector again and keeps its ports still. A port may travel along its own side only where it has the side to itself; the room a crowded side was lending a neighbour is what made a connector slide along both entries as either was carried, which is not something a reader ever asked for.',
'A merge whose entry stands nearly under one of its lineages leaves by that lineage’s landing, and the two share the bead that was already there. The stem used to hang off a second dot a few pixels from the gradient one — one mark, drawn twice.',
'The grips on an entry’s corners and the arm that turns a caption answer nothing while another entry is open, as its link, its citations and its language chips already did. And a connector’s panel no longer hands every other connector on the chart the same panel: closing one used to wash the selection off the drawing, so the click that closed it opened the faded line it landed on, and the next press did it again.',
'A card keeps its picture whole. The band is as deep as the picture needs — a panorama gets a shallow one, a portrait a deep one — and cropping is a choice, with the band’s depth adjustable by hand beside it. A rippled card is airtight: its picture and its rules are cut to the card’s own outline instead of stopping at the rectangle inside it, so no band ends short of the ripple and no rule runs past it.',
'An entry carried up against one it is joined to pushes it. A connector needs two stubs and a corner at each end to be a line at all; squeezed below that the router starts answering with a U out of the bottom of both boxes. So the gap is held at the length where the plain step is still drawn, and the entry in the way moves — in the same step of undo as the move that shoved it.',
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.28', date:'2026-09-18', title:'One border, asked once', notes:[
'The ripple is a ripple rather than a zigzag: half-waves half again as long, drawn as curves instead of as a chain of short straight steps. A connector’s wave is longer still, so a line that wanders reads as one line wandering.',
'And a connector aims at the border that was actually DRAWN. Where the border stands at a given point used to be worked out a second time, by arithmetic describing the drawing rather than reading it — so when the wave was rewritten the description was left half a wavelength out, and every arrow into a rippled entry reached for the trough while the crest was in front of it, stopping in the open air beside the box. The question is answered from the points the border is drawn from, so a change to the drawing carries the answer with it. Adding a border style now means describing that border once; nothing downstream has to be found and put right again.',
'A headless line stops where that border is and a little further in, rather than at the deepest the ripple can ever reach — and a route no longer changes shape when an arrowhead is added or taken away. An arrowhead is a decoration on a relationship; where the line goes is not its business.',
'Two entries a little out of line are joined by one straight run. Each port may travel along its own side as far as its neighbours allow, and a connector could only spend that room when it had a side to itself: a step of twenty or thirty pixels stayed on the chart because the two ports that could have closed it were each sharing their side. A crowded side gives three tenths of the gap to a neighbour now — the fan still reads as evenly spaced, and the kink is gone.',
'Card layout is a card again. Choosing a picture for one works: the field was hidden at the moment the settings opened, and what it held was thrown away on the first commit. A card with no picture has no picture band — the empty frame with a little mountain in it is gone. Its language chips sit at the top-left and its link badge at the top-right, where every other entry wears them, with or without a picture. It can wear the rippled border, and its picture is clipped to it. And its connectors meet the whole of its sides: a band inside an entry is not a second entry, so adding one changes the entry’s size and nothing else.',
'The language tabs are the Tags field: one chip per tab with its short name in it, an × to take it out and a + to add one. A tab’s words are written on the entry with that tab showing, where they can be seen in the face and size they will be read in; renaming a tab keeps them.',
'The entry panel no longer lists what an entry is joined to. The lines on the chart say it, in the place where it means something and in the colours of the lineages.',
'While one entry is open, nothing another entry wears answers the pointer at all — no hand, no highlight, no press — its citations, its link and its language chips alike.',
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.27', date:'2026-09-18', title:'What belongs to what', notes:[
'A lineage feeding a merge leaves by the MIDDLE of its parent’s side, and the ordinary connectors sharing that side step out to the slots furthest from it. Everything else about a merge is symmetric, and the one place it was not was where the line left its own parent — so the bar was built around whichever slot of a fan the lineage happened to be given.',
'A merged lineage takes no hand-set bends. Where it leaves, where it comes down and where it turns onto the bar all belong to the merge, and a point pinned in chart coordinates through that had nothing to hold on to: it pulled the line out of the fan and put a kink in it. The points stay in the file — break the merge and the drawn route comes back — and while the merge stands the panel offers no handles and no straightening.',
'A lineage can be brought down to its bar. It used to be stopped a whole lead short of the entry for no reason a reader could see, and a parent that already stood closer than that was thrown out to the limit by the first pixel of any drag: pick it up to nudge it down and it jumped up instead. It now stops where the shape really runs out — the bar at its innermost, plus the shortest run-up a turn onto it can be drawn with — and where an entry already stands is always allowed.',
'A connector bent by hand keeps its word. It never runs through either of the two entries it joins — it ends on them — so a leg that would cut across one turns the other way round, or goes round the outside on a line taken from that entry’s own edge. A bend dropped ON an entry asks for a route that cannot exist and is left out of the one that is drawn; the handle stays where it was put, and means something again as soon as it is pulled back into the open.',
'And its knee no longer jumps to the far side of its own entry. The sides a connector leaves and arrives by are guessed from where the two entries lie, and that guess flips as they are pulled apart — so the line went out, stopped, and came back past its own box to reach a bend that had not moved. Where the guess would send it away from a bend behind it, the side faces the bend instead, which nothing about moving the entries can change. A bend that is holding a route in place is no longer mistaken for an idle one and deleted: what counts is whether the connector drawn without it is the line already on the page.',
'A portrait is drawn as a circle, so it is never a rippled border. Setting one on a character bio gave its connectors a rectangle’s ripple and a rippled border’s ring spacing to aim at, and they stopped short of the rim or cut into it. A port on a rim also stands inside the square everything else reasons with, and its run-out now covers that difference before anything is measured from it — off the middle of a side, a portrait’s rim is a tenth of its width inside the box, and the corner behind the arrow was being placed over the picture.',
'What belongs to another entry is out of play while one is open. Its citations, its link and its language chips do nothing but open the box they are on, and a citation pressed with nothing open shows the reference without also opening the entry it sits in. The ground under a tagged entry steps back with the rest of the chart instead of staying at full strength, and performs for nobody while something else is being looked at.',
'The language rows lost their formatting toolbar: a tab’s words are dressed on the entry itself, where they can be seen, rather than by a bar of buttons acting on whichever row was last touched. Switching a tab no longer lights the whole chart back up behind the panel. The link badge is a language chip’s size and is a button all the way round — the two edge strips meeting at its corner used to lie across most of it. The two headings over the lineage lists are gone; every row in them already opens with the arrow that says which way it goes.',
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.26', date:'2026-09-17', title:'Remarks that ride their legs', notes:[
'A remark belongs to a part of its connector. Callouts and notes are now kept as a share of the leg they stand on: a stretch that shrinks carries its remark with it in proportion, so a parent slid along its bar no longer shoves the callout on its neighbour’s stretch ahead of it. A remark put with Shift on the middle of the connector, or on the middle of one of its legs, keeps to that middle however the line changes. A note’s place is now actually saved — it was being dropped when the chart was written out.',
'Arrowheads rest on a rippled border. The tip was put on the wave’s centre line at one point, so the neighbouring crests and the border’s own stroke pushed into the head; the head is now lowered onto the stroked border until it touches, at the tip or on a flank, and crosses it nowhere.',
'The squiggle is softer and fills its lines: longer, shallower half-waves, stretched to fit each run and each side exactly, with no bare stretch at the ends or round the corners.',
'On a merge, the lineages at the ends of the bar may go outward — they are what sets its length — and a parent stops only a corner’s width short of its neighbour instead of a box’s. Shift divides the bar evenly about its middle, with as many places as there are lineages and the middle offered separately only when it falls between two.',
'A lone connector dropping onto a side shared by several now takes the whole of the offset itself, and comes down straight.',
'Callouts and notes are set in the same face, the chart’s default one. A click on a callout or a caption only selects it; the Delete and Text cards that came up are gone — the Delete key, the in-place toolbar and the corner grip already do their work.',
'The light on the unreleased ground is a steel sheen that reads on white, and both grounds shine brighter on the dark page. A hub’s echo goes out on the local multiverse’s rhythm: the next wave leaves when the last is half-way.',
'Bends put back to within a grid step of where the connector turned on its own are removed; the trial route that decides this no longer steers around the connector’s own bent self.',
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.25', date:'2026-09-17', title:'Places to put things', notes:[
'The drawing can be dark. The moon in the top bar turns the page over: the panels take a dark palette, and the chart is drawn exactly as on paper and then inverted with its hues turned back, so a red lineage is still red and a portrait still looks like itself. The choice is remembered in the browser.',
'Shift along a connector offers three kinds of place, drawn three ways: the twentieths, the middle of each straight leg, and the middle of the whole connector as a ring. The two ends are no longer offered. A note being slid shows which place it has taken, and a note on the middle stays on the middle however long the connector grows.',
'Shift on a merge marks the places on its bar — its middle, the points halfway between lineages, and for the amalgam itself each lineage — and the entry in the hand snaps to them. A parent carried along its bar stops short of its neighbours and of the bar’s ends, and passes over callouts and notes without moving them. Two parents selected together get a swap button, even when they feed different merges.',
'Centring one entry on another works. Shift put the entry back on the ruled grid before the alignments were weighed, and two boxes of different heights have their middles between grid lines — so only the tops and bottoms were ever on offer. The alignments are weighed at the pointer now. A connector’s own offer was also read from routes a frame old, which put its guide where nothing had been aligned.',
'No more half-unit kinks. The search router works on whole units and a port on a box of odd width sits on a half, so a searched route left its entry on a slant; its ends are put back on their true coordinates, and any run a unit or less out of true is levelled rather than stepped.',
'A hand-set bend that the route no longer needs is removed when an entry is dropped, not only when the bend itself is let go: if the connector without its bends would be the line already drawn, the bends go.',
'The unreleased ruling is drawn with the weave’s pen, and its glare is softer. Both grounds are drawn in their entry’s own coordinates, so the pattern no longer jumps when a carried entry is dropped; their light no longer restarts on the drop or skips when the entry is pressed — a running animation was being sought again on every selection change and every frame of a drag.',
'A sticker or a citation can be put into an entry’s words from the toolbar. The press on the picker closed the field first, because the pickers were excused by class names nothing on the page carried.',
'The wavy line is a squiggle: short, shallow half-sines, on connectors and on a pocket reality’s border alike, instead of a row of half-ellipses.',
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.24', date:'2026-09-17', title:'Nothing moves that was not touched', notes:[
'Nothing moves because something else was moved. That is the whole of this release, found nine ways.',
'Sliding one lineage of a merge along its bar leaves the others where they land. Two lineages closer than a pitch were spread apart and the whole row was then shifted back onto its mean — so the moment a carried parent came near a neighbour, every drop on the bar stepped sideways and the callouts hanging off them went too. Only the lineages that actually crowd each other are spread now, and among them the one in the hand is the one that gives way.',
'A connector’s note stays where it was put. It rode a fraction of its route, and a fraction slides whenever the route changes length, so an edit anywhere that re-routed the line carried the note along it and round corners. It is kept as a point now, as a callout’s anchor already was. And it no longer dodges: the test for an entry in its way used the widest plate a note can ever have, so a three-letter remark stepped away from boxes it was nowhere near and flipped from above its line to below it.',
'A bend a few units off the run out of its port is drawn on that run. Ports move when their side gains a connector or their entry is resized, and a bend stored on the ruled grid then sat three units to one side — out, across, and on: a knee that did not meet. Anything under a grid step is squared away every time the route is drawn. A bend that bends nothing is taken out when it is let go; 0.9.22 said this and the program did not do it.',
'A group carries the bends of the connectors it holds whole. Moving a lasso’s worth of entries re-drew the lines between them out of their new ports and back through their old points.',
'Undo undoes a drag. A bend, a note sliding along its line, and a carried group all change the chart live, so the snapshot taken when they were dropped was a snapshot of the result. They take it on the first frame now. And the same state pushed twice is one step, not two, so the first Ctrl+Z after an edit no longer looks as if it did nothing.',
'Sliding a callout’s anchor lifts that dot and no other; the mark was a class on the page, which every dot matched. A drag no longer puts up the ruled grid when it is switched off. A dimmed connector does not open its panel over a selection — the click lets go of the selection, as a click on the canvas does; the lit ones still open.',
'A local multiverse’s two sheets are half a turn apart. The stagger was written in milliseconds and read in seconds, which made it 500 whole turns: the sheets travelled on top of each other and read as one tab at a time.',
'The unreleased ground is ruled on the weave’s own step instead of half of it, and the light that crosses it is a pale glare rather than a colour. An underline or a sticker under a label too long for its box is cut at the same border as the words.',
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.23', date:'2026-09-15', title:'One place to write', notes:[
'The Label box is gone from an entry’s settings. Its words are written ON the entry — double-click it and the field opens where the text is drawn, in the entry’s own face, size and ink — and keeping a second copy of them in a drawer at the other side of the screen meant two places to type one sentence, joined by a live preview whose only job was to connect them. Everything an entry has that is NOT its words is still in the drawer, unchanged.',
'Nothing was lost with it. The floating toolbar over the field is not a smaller version of the box’s: it is the same one. Every formatting toolbar on this page is fitted out by a single pass — face, size, the rule and the strike with their kind between them, the sticker and the citation — and the field on the entry has always been on that list. Twelve controls, the same twelve.',
'Four controls that nobody could reach went with it. An entry’s own face and size were a hidden pair beside the Label box and a second hidden pair mirroring them in the language rows; none of the four was ever shown, so the drawer was reading its own unreachable values back on every commit, which is the only reason those settings survived at all. They survive by being carried, which is what was meant.',
'And a picture says so in the only place it can now: the field refuses to open on it. The drawer used to answer that by greying out a Label row — the same statement, made where the reader is pointing.'
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.22', date:'2026-09-15', title:'A remark that rides where you put it', notes:[
'A connector’s note is started from its panel and then slides along the line. Its words go on the plate, which left a connector carrying no note with nothing to double-click and so no way to write a first one at all: the panel now puts an empty plate on the middle of the line with the caret in it, and nothing typed means no note. Drag the plate to move it along; Shift offers the places along the line a remark usually wants, the same ones a callout’s anchor is offered.',
'The field breaks the text where the thing under it breaks it, and nowhere else. An entry’s label is drawn on one line and allowed to run past the box, and the field wrapped it at its own border instead — so what you typed and what you got were two different shapes. It now keeps the line breaks that are in the text, invents none, and grows both ways from the entry’s middle exactly as the entry’s own words do. A portrait’s card and a connector’s plate do wrap, so on those the field goes on wrapping at their width.',
'A portrait’s card no longer shuts while its words are being written on it. The card is drawn in SVG and the field is laid over the top, so moving from one to the other LEAVES the card as far as the page is concerned — and leaving it is what closed it, mid-sentence.',
'A lineage cannot be carried through its own merge bar. The bar hangs a fixed clearance short of the nearest parent and may not be pushed inside the entry it feeds, so a parent dragged far enough simply walked through it and came back round the outside. It stops where the bar would.',
'A bend dropped back where it came from puts the connector back the way it was. A bend steps by the ruled grid and the run it was dragged out of does not, so it landed a few units off the line and the route went along, stepped three pixels across, and went on. Within half a grid step the run wins; and a bend that bends nothing is taken out rather than left in the list as a handle to catch on.',
'The unreleased ground is a close grid rather than a comb of bars, and dark enough for the light crossing it to have something to brighten. And a hub’s echoes are all the same echo: each ring used to grow from a little under its own size to its own size, so what left the entry was a small wave, a middling one and a large one in turn. They now cover the same ground, one after another; a local multiverse’s sheets overlap properly for the same reason — the next is at full strength before the last has gone.',
'Typing in a language tab no longer brings the whole chart back. Every entry is rebuilt as you type and what is hidden is a class put on afterwards, which this one preview forgot to put back — so a tag filter came undone on the first keystroke. And a tab’s words are now written on the entry like every other piece of text: switch an entry to a tab, double-click it, and the field opens on THAT tab and writes back to it, leaving the label and the other tabs alone.',
'The callout’s panel has lost the line of prose explaining how to write on the card. A caption that explains a gesture is read every time the panel opens, forever, by somebody who learned the gesture the first time.'
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.21', date:'2026-09-14', title:'One program, thirty-five files', notes:[
'The program is written in thirty-five files instead of one of eighteen thousand lines. Nothing about it changed: the page is still one scope, assembled by writing those files out one after another in a declared order, and the file that comes out of the build is byte for byte the file that came out of it before — which is the proof, rather than the hope, that this was a move and not a rewrite.',
'It is deliberately not a module system, and the reason is in the program rather than in anybody’s taste: drawing, routing and editing call one another in every direction, so there is no order in which each part only uses what came before it. One scope is what a web with cycles in it actually is. Modules would also have needed a bundler, and a bundler would have destroyed the @@EDIT@@ markers the chart is saved through — so the page could no longer save itself, which is the one thing it must be able to do. What was wanted was a file you can hold in your head; that is what this is.',
'The build refuses three ways for the order to quietly stop being true: a part the manifest names and the folder does not have, a part the folder has and the manifest does not name, and the document you develop against running them in a different order from the built page. A part left out of an assembled program does not fail loudly — it fails as a function that is simply not there — so none of the three may produce a page.',
'And the linter now runs against the assembled program rather than against the parts, because “nothing defines this name” and “nothing reads this name” are questions that have no answer about a part on its own. Each complaint is carried back to the file and line it came from; the arithmetic is exact, the assembly being nothing but concatenation.'
  ]},
  {v:'0.9.20', date:'2026-09-14', title:'Nothing quiet left in it', notes:[
'A release with no new drawing in it. Every item below is something the program did wrongly, or expensively, or silently — and silently is the word that ties them together: not one of these had a symptom anybody could have reported.',
'Two entries can no longer share a clipping mask. The masks that hold a portrait’s picture, a card and a caption inside their own outlines were named by replacing every character an SVG id cannot carry with an underscore — which is not a reversible rule and not a unique one either: “Ark 2” and “Ark.2” came out as the same name, and two entries written in Cyrillic came out as the same row of underscores. The second definition then overwrote the first and one entry was clipped by the other’s shape. Nothing warned, because a repeated id inside defs is legal SVG: the last one simply wins. A short hash of the original id now goes on the end, and the readable part is kept so a definition is still recognisable in an inspector.',
'An entry’s id is checked for the one thing it truly cannot be. A control character or a line break survives neither an attribute nor the saved file, and is invisible in every place a reader would look for the mistake. Everything else is allowed — any script, any punctuation, quotes and brackets included — because a chart whose entries are named in Russian is a chart this program has to be able to open. The awkwardness of such a name is handled where it is actually awkward: in the selectors and in the definitions, both of which escape it.',
'The chart survives the project’s change of name. Every key this page writes into a browser still carried the old one, and among them is the key holding THE CHART for anybody keeping their only copy in a browser or on a file they host themselves. The keys are renamed and each one reads the old key first, writing the new one only if it is empty, and never deleting the old — so nothing is lost, newer work is never overwritten by a stale copy, and an older copy of this same file still opens. The exported file is named after the project too.',
'A sticker’s bytes are stored once instead of once per undo step. Every edit takes a snapshot, and a snapshot re-encoded the whole sticker library and the media shelf as text — about a megabyte per keystroke on a modest library, kept sixty times over in the undo stack. Those two are now snapshotted as structure: the record is copied, the base64 is not, so an unchanged image is the same string in the history as on the page and is compared by identity rather than by reading a megabyte. The comparison is exactly as exact as it was, including for an image replaced in place, and anything it cannot speak for falls back to the text form rather than guessing.',
'The build refuses to lose work quietly. Pulling the chart out of a saved page used to skip, in silence, any region the file did not carry — and skipping it reverts that part of the chart to the seed data in the sources. It now stops and names what is missing, stops again if a region arrives emptied or with most of its contents gone, and reports what it carried and how much of it. Both refusals can be overridden deliberately; neither can be walked past by accident. And the two files that hold the chart’s contents — the sources’ copy and the built page a plain rebuild carries from — are put aside before either is written over, three generations deep, for the damage a guard cannot recognise.',
'And eleven bindings that nothing read are gone, along with a second copy of the function that escapes a value for a selector — the lossy one, which was the one being called in some places. The project now carries a linter set to exactly three rules, all three about this class of mistake, and a test for the build script’s refusals, which is the one part of the project the browser suite cannot reach.'

    'The in-node field now opens on everything on this chart that IS a piece of text: an entry\u2019s label, a portrait\u2019s card, a caption, a connector\u2019s note and a callout. Double-click any of them and the words open where they are drawn, in that thing\u2019s own face and size, with the toolbar floating above. The three panels that used to hold a second copy of those words \u2014 the connector\u2019s Note box, the callout\u2019s card, the caption\u2019s Text box \u2014 have lost them; each keeps everything about its subject that is not the words. A remark on a connector still offers no colour box, because it is written in the line\u2019s own ink.',
    'The field and its words scale together. The floor on its width was a flat 120 screen pixels while the type inside it scaled with the drawing, so zooming out left a wide box with a line of ants in it, several times the size of the entry underneath. The padding and the border scale too.',
    'A portrait\u2019s grips are back on the corners of the square it is drawn inside, where its ports are and where every other entry\u2019s are. 0.9.16 moved them onto the rim because reaching for a corner let go of the hover that was showing them; the cause is fixed instead \u2014 the square answers the pointer now, so the ports and the grips stay up until the pointer leaves the BOX. A double click on the circle opens the settings, since a portrait holds a picture; its words are on the card, and a double click there opens them. And the field opens on the card itself rather than beside it: the card\u2019s group also holds the stub joining it to the portrait, so measuring the group put the field half a card to the left.',
    'Selecting an entry no longer redraws its border heavier. Three pixels instead of the entry\u2019s own weight is a change to the drawing rather than a mark on it: a dashed border\u2019s dashes thicken, a double border\u2019s rails close up, a ripple flattens, and the box grows by most of a pixel on every side. The glow says "this one" instead, a little stronger \u2014 which is what a portrait has done since 0.9.18, and is right for every archetype.',
    'A local multiverse\u2019s stack copies the entry\u2019s outline in EVERY border style. Only the ripple was carried across, so a dashed entry stood in front of a stack of solid rectangles \u2014 three boxes meant to read as one world seen three times, drawn three different ways.',
    'A new tag that acts: "unreleased". It lays a cold grey comb of straight verticals under the entry, where fan-fiction lays a warm gold lattice \u2014 the same patch, the same fade, the same performance, a different ruling, because the two say the same kind of thing about a reality and belong in one visual language. An entry can carry both. The fan-fiction weave is set back to about half the strength 0.9.18 gave it: the ground has to stay the ground.',
    'A line break inside formatted words no longer breaks the words. The stored value was split on its newlines and each line was read on its own \u2014 correct only while no piece of formatting spans a break, and the instant one does, which is what Shift+Enter in the middle of an underlined phrase does, one line held an opening with no end and the next an end with no opening. Neither parsed, so both were printed as the literal characters: the markup itself appearing in the text.',

Evenly spaced lineages hand the bar over at one and the same place \u2014 its middle \u2014 so every seam of such a merge resolved to that one point, and the bar carried two or three beads stacked on the same pixel. The middle is drawn only while the entry is carried with Shift held, as the thing being lined up on; a bead is drawn there only if the colour really changes across it.'

Enter settles it; so does a click anywhere else. The words used to be typed into the settings drawer at the other side of the screen, with a live preview as the only thing connecting the two \u2014 which is to say, with the reader watching two places at once. A portrait\u2019s field opens on its CARD, because that is where a portrait\u2019s words are. The drawer still holds everything an entry has that is not its words, and its Label field still works exactly as it did; a caption and a picture keep the card they already had, which stands beside them and carries the same toolbar.',

There is a bin under the search box for tags no category claims: press + and an empty tag shape appears in it with the caret already in it, exactly as a category is renamed on its own heading. Type the name, press Enter, and drag it onto whichever category it belongs to. Nothing typed, Escape, or a click anywhere else, and no tag was made at all. Dropping a tag INTO that bin is how one comes back out of a category \u2014 a gesture there was no way to make before. A new category is written the same way, and Untagged is set in italic, since it is a bin and not a name anybody typed.',
    'The Delete key has stopped dying. Picking an entry up calls preventDefault on its mousedown \u2014 so the browser never starts selecting text as the entry is carried \u2014 and that also cancels the focus change the press would have made, so whatever field was last typed in kept the keyboard: click into a label, click back onto the chart, press Delete, nothing. The chart now remembers where the last press landed, which is what a reader means by which of the two they are working in. A drop-down holding focus no longer counts as typing either, which is why Delete did nothing on a connector whose Path menu had just been used.',
    'The scenery no longer flashes while another entry is being written. A tag\u2019s decorations are rebuilt on every redraw, and the renderer measures text as it works \u2014 a measurement resolves the new element at full strength, and the .dim class arriving a moment later was a real change that started a real fade. Every decoration on the chart flaring and sinking back on every keystroke somewhere else. Nothing about an entry\u2019s own box has ever faded; its scenery now behaves the same way.',
    'And the drawing no longer lurches when a portrait\u2019s card leads into its settings. The canvas was in a container that could still be scrolled by the browser even though nobody could scroll it by hand \u2014 so focusing a field in the drawer the instant it slid in had the browser shove the whole chart 326 pixels sideways to \u201creveal\u201d a panel that was arriving anyway, and slide it back as it landed.',

    'And the merged connector beads every seam on its bar again. 0.9.17 skipped the seams where the two lineages meeting are the same colour, which on a chart of mostly default ink took every bead off every bar. The doubled dot that started all this was never a same-colour seam: it was the seam the junction bead is already standing on, which is what the clearance around the junction deals with.'

Drag one of the pale marks that appear along a line whose panel is open and the line bends there; drag the mark again to move the corner, double-click it to take it out, or press Straighten to lose the lot. A hand-laid corner does not stop the route being a set of right angles — what it changes is which way round the corners go, which is the one thing an automatic router cannot know. Holding Shift lines a corner up with the OTHER connectors and with nothing else: a bend has no edge of its own to match against a box’s, and what it can usefully be level with is the corridor another route already occupies. Corners are written down with the chart and come back with it.',
    'The guides now offer two entries’ MIDDLES before their edges. Two boxes of different heights are close to each other in several places at once, so an edge-to-edge alignment a pixel nearer always won, and the alignment that makes the connector between them run dead straight — the one a reader is nearly always reaching for — could not be reached at all.',
    'A portrait’s card keeps up with the portrait. It used to be redrawn only when the resize finished, so growing a portrait left its card sitting where the old rim used to be for the whole of the drag. Where it hangs is now a choice as well: left, right, or left to the chart — which puts it on whichever side is free.',
    'And every connector into a portrait finishes ON the circle. The ports were worked out from the square the circle is inscribed in, which is the same point for one line and three different gaps for three — the more lines a portrait had, the more visible the wedge of daylight between them and its rim. Picking a portrait out no longer thickens its rim either; the border is a property now, and a selection that quietly redraws it two pixels heavier reads as a size change.',
    'Decorations no longer blink while you type. A tag’s scenery lives in layers that are rebuilt whenever anything on the chart is redrawn — and typing in an entry’s settings redraws it on every keystroke — so an echo half-way out jumped back to the box and a sheet half-way across vanished and set off again. Each performance now remembers when it began and a rebuilt decoration is handed exactly how far through it was.',
    'The merged connector beads only where the colour ACTUALLY changes: three lineages of one colour make one plain bar rather than a bar with two dots on it marking nothing.',

The leash that used to PULL it back towards its lineages is still gone — a position written into the chart is honoured exactly — but the hand is held to the length of the bar, because past the end there is no bar for the stem to leave from.'

An entry now has a BACKGROUND (one colour fills the box, more than one make a gradient across it) and a BORDER STYLE (the same six the connectors offer: solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dotted, double, and the wavy edge a pocket reality used to be). Charts written with the old archetypes open with the new properties set to exactly what they used to draw.',

A connector\u2019s note plate has one of its own in the connector\u2019s panel \u2014 its INK is the line\u2019s and is not the reader\u2019s to set, but what it is written on is. And a label that would be lost against its own ground takes the plain contrasting ink instead, which is how a migrated mirror comes out looking exactly as it did.',
    'The five archetypes that remain are chosen by their pictures in the Add form: a box, a portrait circle, two lineages merging into a box, a box with a T in it, a box with a picture in it. Every one of them is a SHAPE, which is the one thing a drop-down of words cannot say.',
    'A caption is turned by a round arrow at its own top-left corner, not by a slider in a panel \u2014 aiming by eye at one end of the screen while the number changed at the other was never the way to set an angle. Shift steps in eighths of a turn; a double-click puts it back level.',

The drag used to be clamped so the entry could not leave its bar\u2019s reach \u2014 a limit that belonged to a merge whose bar was tied to the entry, which it has not been since 0.9.15. All the clamp still did was stop the hand while the pointer carried on, and pushing further went on shortening the very stem it was meant to protect.',
    'And the doubled dot on the merged connector is gone: the junction bead travels along the bar with the entry, so sooner or later it lands on a joint, and two beads a few pixels apart read as one mark drawn twice. The junction\u2019s is the larger and carries every colour, so where they meet it is the one that stays.',
    'A portrait\u2019s resize grips sit on its rim rather than on the corners of the square it is inscribed in.

It used to be worked out from the two run-outs as shortened — which is the right answer for ports facing EACH OTHER, where two long run-outs would march past one another, and means nothing for two facing the same way. So the level tracked the deeper port until the entries crossed and then dropped to the other one\u2019s bare minimum, a few pixels clear of its border; a few pixels will not pass a neighbouring box, so every stock shape was rejected, the search took over, and the run leapt to wherever it landed. Drag an entry up past its neighbour now and the bend shrinks to one run-out and stays there, with only the moving entry\u2019s own leg growing.',
    'A callout swung about its anchor keeps the angle it was snapped to, exactly. Its corner was rounded to a whole pixel and a port rarely sits on one, so the card\u2019s centre — which is what the leader is drawn to — landed up to half a pixel off and every snap came out at 89.9\u00b0. On a merge, whose ports sit on halves, it came out wrong every time. Two decimals, the same as the anchor drag already kept for exactly this reason.',
    'A portrait\u2019s card no longer blinks. The card layer is cleared and rebuilt whenever anything on the chart is redrawn, and a rebuilt card replayed its entrance — so a portrait keeping its card open flashed it at the reader on every click and every keystroke anywhere. A card that was already up comes back up with no animation; only a new one is introduced.',
    'And it steps back with the portrait it belongs to. The cards sit in a layer of their own that the selection\u2019s wash never reached, so a faded portrait had a card at full strength floating beside it. It also stays away entirely while another entry is selected — not only while that entry\u2019s settings are open, since a selection has already faded the chart around it and a card appearing over that is the same interruption either way.',

The SEAM \u2014 where one lineage hands the bar over to the next and the colours change \u2014 belongs to the merge and stands still however the entry is dragged, which is what keeps a callout anchored on a lineage exactly where it was put. The JUNCTION \u2014 where the merged arrow leaves the bar \u2014 is the stem of a connector, and a connector reaches the thing it feeds: it stands in front of the entry, clamped to the bar, and travels along it as the entry moves. Eight positions across the chart: every drop, the bar\u2019s span and the callout identical to the pixel, and the gradient stem and its bead following the entry the whole way.',
    'Formatting a caption no longer fades the chart. The live preview repaints the highlight after every keystroke, and a free-standing picture or caption is related to nothing \u2014 so it dimmed the entire drawing to a ghost until the commit half a second later redrew it. A flash of transparency across the map on every press of every formatting button, and the reason a colour set on a caption looked like it had done nothing at all.',

It clears everything the reader can set and leaves the inherited ink alone, which is the one thing on those two fields that is not theirs to choose. And that ink now reaches the card the moment the connector\u2019s colour changes, rather than waiting for something else to redraw the entries; the plate around a note wears it too.',
    'Selecting words and then typing a colour for them is one gesture again. A document has one selection and the hex box takes it, so the run being coloured stopped looking chosen the instant the box was clicked \u2014 the range was remembered and applied correctly, but nothing on screen said so. It is painted in the same wash by a highlight that does not own the selection.',

The bar hangs from the lowest lineage and nothing else. Six positions across the chart, and every drop, the bar, the junction and the callout are identical to the pixel.',

Its silhouette is drawn TO the circle: it was set for a fifty-pixel one, so the shoulders crossed the rim before anything was even resized. The card beside it is sized to its words like every other box, rather than to a fixed width whatever it holds.',

Each is now given its own start, and the cycle is a third quicker.',

A hollow border is nothing to click on. The rings are named now.',
    'The card beside a portrait holds itself open while the pointer is on it — reading it meant moving onto it, and moving onto it meant leaving the portrait, which is what closed it.

    'A portrait keeps its picture when it is moved. The clip it is cut to was written into the page\u2019s permanent defs under a name derived from the entry, and nothing ever removed the old one; a fragment reference resolves to the FIRST element with that name, which after the first render is always the stalest — so a moved portrait was still being clipped to the circle it used to stand in.

The pointer pad was being lit too — a rounded rectangle, or on a portrait a ring, of light around a shape the entry is not — and the glow itself was wider than a pocket reality\u2019s ripple is deep, so the wave was smoothed away. A tight shadow traces the outline; a wider one behind it gives the selection its presence.',
