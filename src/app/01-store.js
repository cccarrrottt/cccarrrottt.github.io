   WHERE THE CHART IS KEPT
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   This page began life as a claude.ai artifact, and for a while the only
   way it could save was the one that host provides: publish a new version
   of yourself. That made the chart a hostage of a single website. Opened
   from a disk, or served from anywhere else, it drew perfectly and then
   refused to remember anything.

   It now keeps its work through whichever of three backends is actually
   available, decided at load:

     artifact  — running inside claude.ai with write access. Saving
                 publishes a new version of this page, exactly as before,
                 and the host reloads the view afterwards.
     site      — on the published site, for its owner only: Saving commits
                 the chart to the repository through the write service, and
                 the site shows it once CI has rebuilt it. See SITE_ORIGINS
                 below and 36-site-owner.js.
     standalone— everywhere else: a file on a disk, a plain web server, a
                 local dev build. Saving writes the chart to this browser's
                 storage for this document, and takes effect immediately
                 with no reload.

   The standalone backend keeps DATA, not source code: the four editable
   regions are stored as JSON and read back with JSON.parse, so nothing
   stored can ever be executed. Export writes the whole thing back out as a
   fresh self-contained page — that is the copy you keep, move to another
   machine, or publish anywhere at all.

   The restore below runs before anything else, because the model is built
   from these arrays a few hundred lines down and has to see the right
   contents the first time.

/* The project was called Axiom Nexus before it was called Rhizome, and that
   name is stamped on every key this program has ever written into a browser.
   The old prefix is kept, and read from, because renaming it without carrying
   the old values over would not lose a preference — it would lose THE CHART,
   for anybody whose only copy lives in a browser on their own machine or on
   a file they host themselves. See carryOverKey below. */

   The published site, and who may write to it.

   There used to be four builds of this page, because whether a copy could
   be edited was decided when it was BUILT: an editable one for the owner,
   a read-only one for everybody else, each as a fragment and as a whole
   document. The page the public saw and the page the owner edited were
   different files, and nothing but discipline kept them in step.

   Now there is one file, and the question is asked when it is OPENED. On
   the site's own address the page starts as a reader, and becomes an
   editor only when the write service below confirms that the person
   holding it signed in as the chart's owner. Hiding the controls is not
   what keeps anybody out — every reader receives the editor's code, and
   is welcome to read it. What keeps them out is that the only place a
   write can go is that service, and it checks the signature itself.

   Anywhere else — a file on a disk, a copy somebody hosts, the test
   server — the page is that person's own copy and edits into their own
   browser, exactly as it always has. SITE_API empty means the service is
   not set up yet: the site is then read-only for everybody, the owner
   included, which is the safe way for that to be wrong.

   The rule is deliberately one-directional and non-destructive: the new key

   pre-rename value overwrite work done since the rename, which is the exact
