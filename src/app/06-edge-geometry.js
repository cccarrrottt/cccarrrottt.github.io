/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Waves, drawn along a line rather than instead of one.

   Every earlier attempt built the wavy shape from scratch: arcs laid out
   run by run, a phase grid to keep neighbouring runs and rings in step,
   flats so a crest never sat on a corner, and a separate piece of
   arithmetic answering "where exactly is this border" for anything that
   had to meet it. Each of those was a place for the wave to disagree with
   itself, and the corners were the worst of them — a wave cannot turn a
   right angle, so it stopped short of every bend and started again after.

   This draws the ORDINARY line first — the same rounded polyline every
   other connector is drawn as, the same rounded rectangle every other
   border is — and then runs a wave ALONG it: the path is walked at even
   steps and each point is pushed out along its own normal by
   `amp * sin(2π s / λ)`, where s is how far along the line the point is.
   A corner is not a special case any more: the line curves and the wave
   goes round with it. There is no phase grid, because the phase is the
   distance travelled; there are no flats, because there is nothing to
   protect; and where the border is at any point is the one line of
   arithmetic above rather than a second implementation of the drawing.

   The wavelength is stretched a hair so a whole number of waves fits the
   line exactly, which is what makes a closed border meet itself and an
   open run start and end on the baseline.

   segments is a zigzag with the corners rounded off by nothing at all:
