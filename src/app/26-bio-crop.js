   The character-bio card.

   A bio circle holds a portrait and no words, so its text opens in a card
   beside it. The card is drawn in SVG through the very same code that
   draws a default node — same width, same border radius, same wrapping,
   same font handling — so it doesn't merely resemble a node, it is one.
   That also means it pans and zooms with the chart instead of floating
   over it at a fixed size.

   The card is read-only: a bio's text is its label, edited in the node's
   own settings form like every other entry's, so there is one place to
   change it rather than two that could drift apart.
