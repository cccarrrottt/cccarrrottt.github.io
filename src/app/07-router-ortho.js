   Orthogonal router.

   Every connector now leaves and arrives perpendicular to a known side,
   so routing is done between two "stub" points pushed STUB units straight
   out of each port rather than between the ports themselves. That single
   change is what makes an arrow always meet its node head-on instead of
   grazing along the border, and it gives the router two free interior
   coordinates to bend through.

   Rather than one hard-coded shape per port-pair, a spread of candidate
   polylines is generated and each is SCORED, cheapest wins. The score
   charges for the things that actually make a diagram hard to read, in
   descending order of how much they hurt: crossing a node box, running
   along on top of a connector that's already been routed, sheer number of
   bends, then length. Because edges are routed in order and each one
   registers its own segments, later edges actively steer around earlier
   ones instead of stacking on them.

   It used to be two full stubs and a corner apiece — fifty-two — which is
   how much room a connector would LIKE, not how much it needs. Two

       it shows: it goes on the wave, at the offset worked out for that

       A LINE with no head asks something else: "where can I stop and be

       still leaves a sliver of paper. It goes to the DEEPEST the ripple
       ever reaches, and a hair further — always inside the wave, always
       under the entry's own fill, which hides the overlap completely. No
       phase of the ripple can leave it short. */

       The entry's FILL is ring 0's, and only ring 0's: every further ring

       inside the border's own stroke, which is drawn over it. */

       second implementation of the wave's arithmetic with a sign chosen
       by argument. It is read off the drawn line now (see pocketOutline),
       so the end goes where the border is and a little further in: under
       the entry's own fill on ring 0, under the border's own stroke on
       any ring outside it, and no phase of any ripple can leave it short.
       A border that does not wander at all asks for neither, and stops
       exactly where it always did. */
    /* …and a HEAD goes where the border is at its own point, not where the
       border is at its highest anywhere under the head's width.
     *
       It used to be lowered onto the ripple the way a real triangle would
       come to rest on it — the tip standing off far enough that no crest
       beside it could push into a flank. Geometrically unimpeachable, and
       wrong on the paper: beside a trough the head stopped an amplitude
       short of the border directly beneath it, with clear paper in the
       gap, which reads as an arrow that has not arrived. What it was
       avoiding no longer needs avoiding — the head is drawn over the
       entry and cut off at the entry's own outline (see outsideClipId),
       so the wave takes back whatever the head puts across it, exactly as
       a plain entry's fill does. The arrow meets the border at its own
       point and the border is drawn over its tip. */
    /* …and on an OPEN ring, "where the border is" has to be asked across
       the whole width of the line, not at its centre.
     *
       A line ends square. Where the ripple slopes under it, one corner of
       that square end is deeper than the middle by the line's half-width
       times the slope — and the slope of this ripple reaches nearly one
       in one. Stopped by its middle a fixed underlap below the wave, the
       low corner came out from under the border's stroke into the gap
       between that ring and the next one in, which is the stub seen
       poking through the outer border of an entry with several. There is
       no fill behind an outer ring to bury it, so the end is placed from
       the HIGHEST point of the wave anywhere under the line, less the
       border's own half-stroke: every column of the line stops inside the
       stroke, and since the ripple never climbs more than a stroke's
       width across a line's width, every column also still reaches it. */

   A fixed distance is right for two entries that are a comfortable way
   apart, and wrong for two that are close: once the gap between the ports
   is not much more than two stubs, the pair of straight run-outs overshoot
   each other and the route has to fold back on itself to reconnect — the
   little hook that appeared whenever an entry was dragged near its
   neighbour. Letting the stub shrink with the distance keeps the run-out
   long enough to leave the border cleanly while giving the elbow somewhere
   to go, so a short connector stays a plain step instead of breaking. */

 * side of its baseline, and inside the outer borders of an entry drawn with
 * more than one. The turn then happened within the entry's own decoration,

     of the entry rather than leaving it, turning, and arriving. An entry
     with one plain border has nothing to clear and keeps the old minimum
     exactly, which is what keeps two entries side by side connected by a
     plain step rather than a detour. */

     lumping them together is what made a pocket reality's connectors read

     Extra rings genuinely need the long run-out described above: the line
     has to get past several concentric strokes before there is anywhere
     for a corner to happen, so the clearance, the corner's radius and the
     arrowhead all have to fit end to end.
   *
     A ripple is not that. It is one border that wanders about three pixels
     either side of where a plain border would be — less than the ordinary
     minimum run-out already clears. Charging it the ring treatment gave
     every pocket reality a run-out three times longer than its neighbours
     got, so a connector between two ordinary entries stepped across
     directly while the very same connector into a pocket marched out,
     turned late and came back: the same relationship drawn two ways. It
     now takes the ordinary minimum, widened only if the ripple is somehow
     deeper than that. */

     the corner into open ground while the line it belongs to has already
     gone off sideways — and the line is cut back by the head's length as
     well, so what is left is a triangle at the border and a line starting
