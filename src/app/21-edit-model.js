   Editing model: local edits, one explicit Save.

   Why this shape rather than continuous autosave: saving here means
   publishing a new version of this very page, and the host then reloads
   the view. That reload is inherent to publishing — it is not something a
   nicer implementation could hide. So Google-Docs-style "save silently as
   you type" would mean reloading the page every few seconds, which is
   strictly worse than saving by hand. Batching instead gives the best of
   both: every edit is instant and local with no reload at all, and the
   single unavoidable reload happens once, when you ask for it.

   Everything on screen is therefore built from workingNodes + EDGE_STYLES
   in memory. An edit mutates those, rebuilds the view, and marks the page
   dirty. Save is the only thing that touches the published document.

 *
 * "Is this chart dirty?" is asked after every single edit — every keystroke
 * in a text field included — and it used to be answered by serializing the
 * whole chart into one string and comparing it. That is exact, and it stays
 * exact through an undo back to the saved state, which a mutation flag never
 * would; the derived answer is the right design and is kept.
 *
 * What it cost was hidden in the stickers. A sticker is a base64 data URI, so
 * a modest library of forty small images serializes to about a megabyte —
 * measured at 1.24 ms of the 1.39 ms each check took, and a megabyte of
 * garbage per keystroke — to re-confirm bytes that had not changed since the
 * page loaded.
 *
 * Two changes, each exact, neither a heuristic. Comparison goes region by
 * region and stops at the first difference, so an edit to an entry settles
 * the question in 0.02 ms without looking further. And the two regions that
 * hold the bytes are snapshotted by structure instead of by text, so they
 * are compared by reference and stored once rather than once per undo step;
 * that part is explained where it is implemented, below the list.
 *
 * The alternative to both — an epoch counter bumped wherever STICKERS is
 * written — would be faster still and would quietly start lying the day
 * someone adds a write site and forgets to bump it. Nothing here has an
 * invariant a future edit can break. */
/* EVERY region the save writes, and nothing else.
 *
 * This list and writeChart's must agree, and for three regions they did
 * not: references, tag categories and the chart's own settings were saved
 * but never snapshotted. Nothing that touched them counted as a change, so
 * the Save button stayed greyed out reading "Saved", Ctrl+S returned
 * without doing anything, the beforeunload guard stayed quiet, and the
 * work was gone on the next reload. Undo had the mirror of the same hole:
 * deleting a cited reference strips its marks from the labels, and undoing
 * put the marks back while leaving the reference deleted.
 *
 * One list, used by the snapshot, the comparison and the restore, so the
 * three cannot drift apart again. */

   Snapshotting, when some of what is in there is base64.

   takeSnapshot runs on EVERY edit and isDirty on every keystroke, and both
   used to serialize whatever they were given. That is exact and, for text,
   free. For the things this chart embeds it was neither: a sticker library
   is about a megabyte of base64, an embedded clip is larger still, and a
   portrait hangs off an entry.

   Two of those three were dealt with by snapshotting stickers and media as
   flat records, so the base64 was held by REFERENCE and compared with ===.
   It worked, and it left the third alone. Entries kept going through
   JSON.stringify whole, portraits and all — measured on a synthetic chart:

       60 entries, no portraits    isDirty 0.01 ms    undo stack  0.2 MB
       60 entries with portraits   isDirty 2.05 ms    undo stack 62.1 MB

   a megabyte of garbage per keystroke, and sixty copies of the same
   pictures, which is precisely the fault the flat-record snapshot was
   written to cure. It was cured for two REGIONS when what it is about is
   the CONTENT: bytes are heavy wherever they sit, and an entry is not a
   flat record, so the old mechanism could not have been pointed at it.

   So there is one mechanism now and it asks about content. A region is
   serialized with every long string lifted out and replaced by its index,
   and the strings are kept beside the text. What that buys is what the flat
   record bought, for anything of any shape: the base64 is stored once and
   compared by identity, and the text that remains is small enough that
   comparing it is free.

   Nothing here assumes a shape, so nothing falls back to a slower form it
   might have got wrong, and there is no counter for a future write site to
   forget. A restore parses fresh objects every time, so the history cannot
   be rewritten by a later edit reaching into it — the reason the flat form
   copied its records on the way out.
