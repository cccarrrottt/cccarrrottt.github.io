   Which entry's decorations are performing.

   A tag with an effect draws something around its entry — a weave, an
   echo, a stack of sheets — and until now those were still pictures. Still
   is right for the chart at rest: a page where a dozen things are moving
   at once is a page nobody can read, and the movement would be saying
   nothing that the picture does not already say.

   It is worth something at exactly two moments: when the pointer is on the
   entry, and while the entry is open in the panel. Both are the reader
   asking "what is this one?", and the answer each decoration gives is the
   thing it means — the echo goes out, the light crosses the weave, the
   stack streams away and dissolves.

   Driven from here rather than from the stylesheet because the decorations
   do not live inside the entry: they are in layers of their own, under the
   connectors, and no selector reaches a sibling three parents away.

     internal spacing exactly instead of each member snapping separately.

     Three ways to place an entry:

     Ctrl lifts it off the grid entirely. The grid keeps a hand-arranged
     chart tidy, but it makes some things impossible: two connected entries
     of different heights have their ports at whatever offset their sizes
     give them, and if that offset is not a whole number of grid steps no
     amount of snapped dragging will ever line them up. Ctrl is the way out.

     Plain dragging snaps the MOVEMENT, not the position. This is the fix
     for the thing that made Ctrl nearly useless: lining two entries up and
     then nudging one anywhere else used to re-snap it to absolute grid
     coordinates, throwing the alignment away. Snapping the delta instead
     moves in tidy grid steps while carrying whatever fine offset the entry
     already has, so an alignment survives every later move.

     Shift is how you deliberately give that offset up — it snaps the
     position itself, putting the entry back on the grid proper. */
  /* A callout is carried about its ANCHOR, not about the ruled grid.
   *
     What a reader adjusts on a callout is which way it stands off the
     place it points at and how far — that is the whole of its position,
     and it is the pair the placing gesture asked for in the first place.
     So the same two keys mean here what they meant there: Shift snaps the
     ANGLE to eighths of a turn and draws the eight rays it is snapping to,
     Ctrl comes off the grid, and a plain carry snaps the distance. The
     entry-to-entry alignment guides are not offered at all: lining a
