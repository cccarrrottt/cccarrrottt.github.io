/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Guaranteed obstacle-free routing (A* over a coordinate lattice).

   The handful of stock shapes above cover the ordinary cases beautifully
   and cost almost nothing, but they can only ever bend twice — so when a
   node sits squarely in the way there are arrangements none of them can
   solve, and the connector had no choice but to run over the box. This is
   the fallback for exactly those cases, and unlike the old fixed sweep of
   bypass lanes it will find a route whenever one exists, with as many 90°
   bends as it takes.

   The lattice is the standard construction for orthogonal diagram
   routing: take the interesting X coordinates (each obstacle's two
   margins, plus both endpoints) and the interesting Y coordinates, and
   cross them. Any obstacle-free orthogonal path can be deformed onto that
   grid without crossing anything new, so searching it loses nothing — and
   it stays small (a few dozen lines each way) no matter how large the
   chart's actual coordinates are.

   Cost is length plus a turn charge, so among equally clear routes it
   returns the straightest one rather than a staircase.

       with one plain border is ZERO — so an end could be pulled until its
       run-out sat exactly on the port, the tidy pass then merged the two
       coincident points, and what was left was a two-point path between
       two ports that are almost never aligned: a DIAGONAL, drawn on a
       chart whose every other line turns square corners. The arrowhead,
       which takes its angle from that last segment, then came in at a
       slant too. Both are visible in an entry feeding a merge alongside
       other connectors, which is where the case arises.

   reconcile. The old version faded a sampled sine in and out with an
   envelope and then smoothed the samples, which is where its softness and
   its faint kinks at the corners came from. */

 * cost twice over. It spent a corner flat at each false join, so a short
 * connector was mostly bald with a couple of arcs marooned in the middle;
 * and the direction vote read the collinear neighbour as a turn, where the
 * dot product is exactly zero and there is nothing to learn.
