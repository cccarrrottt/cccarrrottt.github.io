     * from the centre of the entry's edge — and the one place it was not
     * was where the lineage left its own parent: the even share along
     * that side put it a third or a fifth of the way along, so the line
     * came out of the box beside the middle and the bar had to be built
     * around where it happened to land. Off-centre by a few pixels reads
     * as a mistake on a construction that is otherwise plumb.
     *
     * So the merged lineages take the middle of the side and share it
     * between themselves when a parent feeds more than one merge from the
     * same edge — which is the same even share, about the same centre.
     * The ordinary connectors on that side then take the slots FURTHEST
     * from the middle out of the fan they would all have shared, so they
     * neither land on a lineage nor bunch up on one side of it. */
