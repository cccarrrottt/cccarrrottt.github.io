   One render of a 120-entry chart asked 3,360 times and asked about only

   search steps a candidate box up in tens and re-measures every word at
   every width. Remembering the answers turns almost all of that into a map
   lookup.

   The cache is dropped wholesale once it grows past a sane size rather

 * builds the text off-canvas and asks getBBox for the result — a forced,
 * synchronous layout, taken while renderNodes is appending to the very same
 * SVG. Measured on a synthetic chain: it is 54–63% of everything a rebuild
 * costs, at exactly two calls per entry.
 *
 * Two calls per entry is not an estimate either. renderNodes measures every
 * text an entry can show in order to size the box, and then measures the
 * ACTIVE one again to centre it — with the same maxChars and the same fit,
 * both computed above and unchanged in between. So half of every render's
 * measurements were already answered during that same render, before any
 * question of remembering them across renders arises.
 *
 * WHAT THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON, which is what the key has to carry:
 *
 * The arguments, and one thing that is not among them. A citation draws as
 * the number the reference has IN REFS — refMarkText reads its position —
 * so reordering the list changes `[9]` to `[10]` and with it the width of
 * every text that cites it. That is the whole of the hidden state: a
 * sticker's box is stickerBox(fontSize), a function of the size alone, so
 * neither the picture nor the library it comes from can move anything.
 *
 * So a text carrying no citation is keyed by its arguments, and one that
 * does also carries the order of the reference keys. Nothing here is a
 * counter that a future write site can forget to bump; the key is derived
 * from the state it depends on, every time.
 *
 * Fonts are the other way answers go stale — every width changes at once
 * when a webfont lands — and that is handled where measureCache handles it,
 * by emptying both and redrawing. */

 * The box used to be sized from a line count times a nominal line height
