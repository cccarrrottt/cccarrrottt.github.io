 * cap of the line was drawn above the entry too, to cover the trough —
 * which, once the tip came back out, was simply a stub of the connector
 * poking through the border into the box.
 *
 * All of it is gone. A ripple is a border like any other: the line stops
 * at it, the head stands on it, and the border is drawn over the head's
 * tip exactly as a plain rectangle's border is. The wave crosses the last
