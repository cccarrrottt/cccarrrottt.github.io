"""What build.py must refuse.

The browser suite can only test the page. This tests the one part of the
project that runs outside it, and it tests the part that can lose work:
--pull takes the chart's contents out of a saved copy of the live page and
writes them back into src/data.js, so a source file that is truncated, or
saved wrong, or simply not the file the person meant to pass, is a data
loss with no undo behind it.

Every case runs against a throwaway copy of the project, so nothing here
can touch the real src/data.js.
